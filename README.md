# Covid-19 Spending Analysis

# Overview
With the vast influx of data over the Covid-19, our team will try and analyze the data to find trends related to the financial support and the Covid-19 rates. We plan to test our hypothesis using publicly available datasets, the scope of this project is within the USA. This will give the team members the opportunity to scrape website data, merge datasets together, and construct meaningful insights from the data.

What data do we want to compare?

There is a lot of the USA to cover, so we think the best way to find insights, would be to compare states. Following this, we are comparing states alongside GDP, population, and geography.

## 1 Hypothesis
1. There is a correlation between the Covid-19 patients and financial incentives.
2. There is a negative correlation between spending and Covid-19 deaths.

We believe that there must be a link between the financial incentives of the hospitals and the reporting of data. The main point for our observation will be the effectiveness of hospitals in regards to their funding. Obviously there are positives to funding the hospitals, we suspect the data will show the same; but we hope we can bring to light new insights!

## 2 Motivation
A year into the Covid-19 pandemic and our team is exhausted. The risk is ever important, but the pandemic has started to shift our personal perceptions in away from reality of the current situation. Following in the footsteps of data scientists before us, we want to analyze Covid-19 and it's effects by studying the investments made to combat the virus. We believe re-evaluating the data can help bring new insights onto Covid-19 trends.
